📄 Keylogger – Educational Proof of Concept

This repository contains a lightweight, educational keylogger proof-of-concept built to demonstrate how keystroke logging mechanisms work internally.
It is intended for:

🔍 Cybersecurity learning

🛡️ Defensive security research

🧪 Demonstrating detection & mitigation techniques

🧠 Understanding how keylogging behavior can be monitored and analyzed

⚠️ Important: This project is for ethical, educational, and authorized research only.
Do not use this tool for malicious purposes, unauthorized monitoring, or violating privacy laws.
Always obtain explicit permission before running monitoring software on any device you do not own.

📚 Features

Captures keystroke input at the OS level

Logs output to a local file

Lightweight and minimal codebase for easy learning

🛠️ How It Works (High-Level Explanation)

This project demonstrates the fundamentals of keystroke monitoring by:

Registering input event hooks

Listening for keyboard activity

Writing the captured data to a safe, local output

Allowing researchers to study log patterns and detection methods

No exploits or privilege-escalation techniques are used.
